# Beam blocker attenuation factor is dependent on beam energy.
# Here we hardcode the results of the attenuation measurements,
# since sometimes data is taken without a previous measurement
# available and so the archived PV for attenuation is sometimes
# inaccurate.


# NOTES: 

_ATTEN={}

# TO run the mya2ccdb.py code, I will need to run each target separately, since the code only supports attenuation of a given beam energy and target
# so will have to uncomment ONLY one: _ATTEN[beam_energy]=att_factor below, for a particular target, and run the mya2ccdb.py code

# C. Yero May 19, 2022 | Work Summary:
# 0) For each of the run ranges below (separated by target changes), I determined the start_time of 1st run and end_time of last run in the range
# 1) ran the mya2ccdb.py code for each range, and made comments regarding any errors mya2ccdb.py might have displayed. I also made a directory for each run range
#    with informations such as the mya2ccdb output and a MyaPlot of the run range
#
# 2) for each range, provided mya2ccdb.py ran without errors: I checked the beam_stop in MyaPlot and made sure it was consistent with beam blocker atten. output from mya2ccdb.py 
#    NOTE: For most run ranges, the Mya beam_stop paramter had a small, dip, which I checked to make sure it DID NOT occur in the middle of a run, by examining
#    the run start_time / end_time in: https://clas12mon.jlab.org/runs/summaries/,  and making sure the dip was actually in-between runs, and that the adjacent runs had
#    a attenuation factor consistent with the ouput from mya2ccd.py.  For each range I made a note under the 'Mya_beam_stop', as to whether the beam blocker was OUT 
#    and whether or NOT it was taken out during a run
#
# Observations / Questions for Nathan: 
# 0) I noticed some of the run times in the clas12mon.jlab.org/runs/summaries were inconsistent with the run time of PV B_DAQ:run_number
#    (for example, see run 15042, where in clas12mon is says: 11:02:53 - 11:19:40. whereas in B_DAQ_run_number it run time keeps going until ~17:32:18 .   
#    Will use the run range times in clas12mon for now. 
#
# 1) I noticed from the output of mya2ccdb, the SLM slope (usually 1.0 ) was inconsistent with the SLM slope in MyaPlot (~ thousands) (see, for example, Run range: 15178-15317)
#    the faraday cup slope / offsets in the output were consistent with those in the MyaPlot 
#
# 2) Runs 15726, 15727 in clas12mon.jlab.org/runs/summaries, shows it still has beam energy of 2 GeV, so I excluded those. Also, from attenuation 
#    factors table, the range 15726-15732 has no attenuation factor, so I put in 16.40835, presumably since the other Empty runs at this beam energy 
#    have that attenuation
#
# 3) FOr some of the run ranges (see below) --->  # ERROR: File "mya2ccdb.py", line 233, in <module> data=dict(offset,**atten)  TypeError: type object argument after ** must be a mapping, not NoneType
#                                                 # ERROR:  File "mya2ccdb.py", line 198, in <module> offsets[len(offsets)-1].runMax=None IndexError: list index out of range
#
# 4) Is it possible to cut out parts of a run, say if the beam blocker was OUT for a brief period of time during a RUN, can we cut out the scaler read corresponding to that part?
#    How often are the Hall B scalers read out, and is that readout stored in such a way it can be retrieved later via a loop over each scaler read ???
